### Setup - Instructions for installation and configuration in bash

1. Clone the git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kajinmo/data-engineering.git
cd data-engineering
```

2. Configure the correct Python version with `pyenv`:
```bash
pyenv install 3.12.3
pyenv local 3.12.3
```

3. Configure `poetry` for Python version 3.12.3 and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry env use 3.12.3
poetry shell
```

4. Install project dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

5. Open vscode:

## One Billion Row Challenge: Python Edition
This project is inspired by The One Billion Row Challenge, originally proposed for Java and later adapted to Python by Luciano Galv√£o.

### Project Overview
The goal of this challenge is to compare different methods of processing a massive dataset (~14GB) containing 1 billion rows, using Python. The task involves calculating statistics (including aggregation and sorting) and was replicated in three different ways:
- Pandas
- DuckDB
- Native Python

### Dataset
The data consists of temperature measurements from various weather stations, randomly generated by the 'create_measurements.py' script. Each record has two attributes:
- Station Name: A string representing the weather station.
- Measurement: A floating-point value (with one decimal precision) representing the temperature.

```
Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
Bridgetown;26.9
Istanbul;6.2
Roseau;34.4
Conakry;31.2
Istanbul;23.0
```

### Task
The task is to write a Python program that reads the generated large data file containing temperature measurements and calculates the following statistics for each weather station:
- Minimum Temperature (min_temperature)
- Average Temperature (mean_temperature, rounded to one decimal place)
- Maximum Temperature (max_temperature)
